Build #2
    [+] Turned off portrait mode. (Already handled the issue of selecting from photo library by having a popover)
    [+] Bread loaf dip and cubes temperature? (Cubes lower temp, maybe 300?)
    [+] Remove 'either' from the chocolate peanut butter balls instructions.
    [+] Strawberry Jello Salad: change Dream whip to Cool whip
    [+]   -> Under notes, allow plenty of time for jello to thicken, do not pour over 2nd layer until thick (You may want to make this recip ethe day/night before serving).
    [+] Sweet and Sour Pork:
          -> "I always marinate for hours before cooking.  I do believe this is the key to having the ribs fall off the bone tender! I just use a large bottle of Kikkoman Marinade and Sauce, but I am sure other marines are fine."
